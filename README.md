## Description
Library Book Demand Microservices
Overview

This project consists of microservices implemented with NestJS to manage book demands in a library. The system is designed to handle the following functionalities:

    Demand Book Service: Receives requests to borrow books, saves the demand information in a database, and publishes the demand to a RabbitMQ queue for further processing.

    Process Demand Book Service: Listens to the RabbitMQ queue for book demands, processes them, and updates the book availability status. It responds to the Demand Book Service with the processing outcome.

Features

    Microservices Architecture: The project is structured using a microservices architecture to ensure modularity and scalability.

    RabbitMQ Integration: RabbitMQ is utilized for event-driven communication between microservices, ensuring seamless communication and loose coupling.

    TypeORM for Database: TypeORM is used for database interactions, providing a convenient and flexible way to work with the underlying database.
